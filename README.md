# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A console version of Rock Paper Scissors as part of the TOP (The Odin Project)

### Overview

This is a console version that I built as part of an assignment by The Odin Project's curriculum. It is only running in an empty HTML
file for now, but styling will be done later. 

### Learning outcome

My two most notable learning outcomes were a deeper understanding of working with arrays and nested functions. For the game() function,
which runs 5 rounds of "Rock Paper Scissors", I had to use two different sub functions, one for randomising the computers pick and another 
one that handles the actual gaming.
